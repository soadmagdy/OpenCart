## 📋 Test Cases – OpenCart Project

### 👤 Contributor: Soad Magdy

Worked on designing and documenting manual test cases for key e-commerce functionalities in the OpenCart platform:

- 🛒 **Shopping Cart**  
  - Verified add/remove/update product quantity  
  - Checked price calculations and cart persistence

- 🖼️ **Product Display**  
  - Tested image loading, descriptions, and product availability  
  - Validated responsive layout across devices

- ⚖️ **Product Compare**  
  - Created test cases for adding/removing items from comparison  
  - Verified UI layout and feature availability across compared products

All test cases are designed to ensure functionality, usability, and reliability of core features in a real-world user scenario.
